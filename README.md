# Phage-ENV
An ML platform to predict phage activity in diverse biological environments. 

Train a custom model to predict phage activity from your experimental data. Use your model to predict phage activity in novel environments. 
Then re-train your model with your experimental findings to complete the learning loop. 

All predictions are made with Random Forest classification, with customizable parameters and train-test splits.
